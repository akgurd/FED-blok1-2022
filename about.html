            <h2>Moco Amsterdam</h2>
            <p>Moco Amsterdam is housed in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam.
                The
                building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers, designer of
                Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum. This privately-owned residence was one of the first
                family
                homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to
                priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office
                for a
                law firm.</p>

            <h2>Moco Barcelona</h2>
            <p>Moco Barcelona is located in a 16th Century palace on Montcada Street in the heart of Barcelona. Palacio
                Cervelló is formerly the private residence of the noble Cervelló family until the 18th Century. The
                building
                embraces a mix of styles that shows a colorful, grand history over centuries. Incorporating parts of a
                previous construction from the 15th Century – interior courtyard, arched staircase with columns,
                capitals,
                and Renaissance-type moldings – Palacio Cervelló welcomes visitors with an impressive Gothic facade.
                From
                the Middle Ages to the 20th Century, aristocrats, merchants, and royals have held onto this historical
                site.
